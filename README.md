# Qt-Pop
modern, modular Qt styling library for desktop applications. qt-pop provides fonts, icons, themes, and UI utilities to make your PyQt/PySide apps look polished, consistent, and ready for production. Customize colors, switch themes, and integrate sleek icons—all with minimal effort.

## Demo application

A frameless, stacked QtPop showcase lives in `demo_app/`. It highlights the
configuration parser, font loader, icon utilities, token-aware QSS processing,
shared data layer, logger stream, and the reusable custom title bar widget.
Launch it with:

```bash
python -m demo_app.main
```

The demo expects PySide6 to be installed and will automatically load the sample
configuration in `demo_app/config/demo_config.json`.
